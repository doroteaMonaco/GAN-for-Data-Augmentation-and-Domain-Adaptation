# GAN for Data Augmentation and Domain Adaptation

## 📋 Project Overview

**Project Code:** 2.10

### Objective

Design and implement a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based system to augment a limited dataset in a chosen domain (e.g., medical imaging, remote sensing, gesture recognition, or defect inspection).

#### Main Goals

- **Primary Objective:** Generate realistic synthetic data that improves downstream model performance in classification or detection tasks, especially when training data are scarce or imbalanced.

- **Secondary Objective:** Explore domain adaptation between real and synthetic data to improve the generalization capabilities of the classifier (and eventually using a different target domain as test set).

## 📊 Dataset Requirements

The dataset may be collected ad hoc or sourced from a public repository containing a small-scale domain-specific dataset.

### Documentation Requirements

For the dataset, report:

- **Class label and data source**
- **Dataset statistics:**
  - Counts per class
  - Imbalance ratio
  - Distribution characteristics
- **Domain characteristics and intended augmentation scope:**
  - Intra-class diversity
  - Dataset balancing
  - etc.

### Final Dataset Structure

The final dataset must include:

1. **Reduced baseline subset** for initial experiments
2. **Augmented version** enriched with synthetic data
3. **(Optional)** Third dataset for domain adaptation

---

## 🔬 Experimental Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Evaluation

Train and evaluate a classifier (e.g., CNN or transformer-based model) on the reduced baseline dataset.

**Metrics to record:**
- Accuracy
- F1-score
- Confusion matrices

*Goal:* Quantify the limitations due to data scarcity.

### Phase 2: GAN Implementation

1. Implement and train a GAN for generating synthetic samples that mimic the real data distribution
2. Perform qualitative and quantitative evaluation of synthetic data

### Phase 3: Augmented Training & Comparison

1. Retrain the same classifier on the augmented dataset (real + synthetic data)
2. Compare performance with Phase 1 to assess the contribution of GAN-based augmentation --> Synthetic images NEVER go into test.
3. **(Optional)** Introduce adversarial domain adaptation to improve generalization across domains (i.e., to reduce the effect of domain shift during training & testing)

## 💡 Expert Advice for Brilliant Implementation

### 1️⃣ Dataset Selection & Preparation

**Pick a dataset with clear scarcity or imbalance** — that's where your GAN will show its value.

#### Recommended Examples:

- **Medical imaging:** chest X-rays, skin lesion images, MRI slices
- **Remote sensing:** satellite imagery of land cover types
- **Gesture recognition:** small video/image datasets
- **Defect inspection:** manufacturing images (metal scratches, PCB defects)

#### 💎 Novelty Tip
Use a **multi-class imbalanced dataset** or a dataset with rare categories — your GAN can focus on synthesizing underrepresented classes.

#### Documentation Best Practices
Be thorough with dataset statistics:
- Class distribution
- Imbalance ratio
- Intra-class variability
- Visualizations like histograms or t-SNE embeddings

---

### 2️⃣ GAN Architecture Selection

Start simple but modern:

- **StyleGAN2 / StyleGAN-T** for images (good for high-quality diverse images)
- **Conditional GAN (cGAN)** for class-conditioned augmentation
- **Diffusion models** could be considered, but GANs are lighter for a university project

#### 💎 Novelty Tips

1. **Focus on class-conditioned diversity:** Generate multiple variations for rare classes
2. **Hybrid architectures:** Combine cGAN with attention layers or patch-based discriminators to improve fine details
3. **Domain adaptation-ready:** Integrate a small adversarial domain classifier to encourage synthetic data to match target domain statistics

### 3️⃣ Training Tips for Success on Limited Hardware

#### Image Resolution
Keep small (128×128 → 256×256) for fast iteration.

#### Data Augmentation
Use standard augmentations (flip, rotation, crop) to improve GAN training.

#### GAN Tricks

- Use **spectral normalization** in the discriminator for stability
- Use **R1 regularization** for better convergence
- Consider **progressive growing** if higher resolution is needed
- **Save checkpoints frequently** — GANs can be unstable

#### Evaluation Metrics

**Quantitative:**
- FID (Fréchet Inception Distance)
- IS (Inception Score)
- Precision/recall for generative models

**Qualitative:**
- Visualize synthetic images for realism & diversity

**Structure**
- Start with 1k vs 10k samples 
- Train on both classes 
- Train with balanced batches 50/50
- User cWGAN-GP (conditioned GAN with Wasserstein loss and Gradient Penalty)
- Generate other 2k/3k of images from underepresented class (don't match 10k - 10k)

---

### 4️⃣ Classifier & Augmentation Experiments

#### Phase 1 (Baseline)
Train a classifier on the small dataset. Record metrics, confusion matrices, class-specific performance.

#### Phase 2 (GAN Synthetic Data)
- Generate balanced synthetic samples for underrepresented classes
- **(Optional)** Explore style interpolation or latent space traversal to increase intra-class diversity

#### Phase 3 (Augmented Classifier)
- Train classifier on real + synthetic dataset
- Compare performance improvement

#### 💎 Novelty Tip
Test **domain adaptation:** e.g., train on synthetic + source real, test on a slightly different target domain.

---

### 5️⃣ Novel/Extra Ideas to Stand Out

#### Conditional Diversity Control
Allow your GAN to control intra-class variation, producing "rare" styles.

#### Domain Adaptation
Use a **Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN)** on the classifier to improve robustness to domain shift.

#### Evaluation Beyond Standard Metrics
- Compare t-SNE embeddings of real vs synthetic data
- Use classifier uncertainty as a metric for how realistic/usable the synthetic data is

#### Interactive Demo / Reproducibility
Provide a small web interface or notebook to generate synthetic samples on the fly.
